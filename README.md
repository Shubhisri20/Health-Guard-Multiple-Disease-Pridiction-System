Multiple Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning
Overview
The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of various diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and more. By analyzing user-provided health data, the system can provide predictions that may assist in early diagnosis and prompt medical attention.

Features
Multi-Disease Prediction: Supports the prediction of multiple diseases using a single platform.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for inputting health data.
Real-Time Predictions: Instant results based on input data.
Scalable Architecture: Easily extendable to include more diseases.
Dataset
The project uses datasets from trusted sources like the UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle, and others. These datasets include various health parameters (e.g., blood pressure, glucose levels) necessary for accurate predictions.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
pickle
Flask (for the web application)
Machine Learning Algorithms:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Frontend: Streamlit
Backend: Python

Usage
Input the necessary health data into the provided fields.
Click on the "Predict" button.
View the prediction results for each disease.
